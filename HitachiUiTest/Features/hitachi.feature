Feature: Hitachi search

#The Problem:
#We want to automate crucial user workflows for https://global.hitachi-solutions.com/ site.
#We need to cover the following functionalities :

#User can successfully open returned search results
#The Solution:
#
#- Please code up a suite of functional test cases in the language of your choice
#- Include both positive and negative cases
#- Be able to quantify the number of distinct tests run
#- Clearly articulate your assumption
